# WellNest-Smart-Mental-Health-Capsules
AI, IoT, and VR-powered smart mental health capsules for student hostels

## Introduction
Mental health challenges among students, especially those in hostels, have been widely recognized. The **WellNest** project addresses this issue by developing smart mental health capsules that provide private, technology-assisted relaxation spaces.

WellNest integrates **AI, IoT, VR, and biofeedback** to create personalized relaxation experiences based on individual stress levels and emotional states. It leverages **real-time physiological monitoring** and **adaptive environmental controls** to ensure a scientifically-backed approach to mental wellness.

## Proposed Solution
### Key Features
- **AI-driven Mood Personalization**: Uses EEG and PPG sensors to detect stress and recommend relaxation techniques.
- **VR-based Therapy**: Provides immersive meditation, guided breathing, and nature simulations.
- **Biofeedback System**: Monitors heart rate, skin conductance, and breathing patterns to adapt relaxation experiences.
- **Adaptive Lighting and Sound Control**: Uses LED lighting and ambient sounds to optimize relaxation and sleep.
- **Privacy and Comfort Features**: Soundproofing, ergonomic seating, air purification, and temperature control.

### Data Flow & Processing
- **Data Collection**: Sensors capture real-time physiological and environmental data.
- **AI-based Emotion Recognition**: Detects stress levels and suggests personalized relaxation techniques.
- **Decision-Making Algorithm**: Recommends relaxation strategies based on sensor inputs.
- **VR and Biofeedback Adaptation**: Adjusts therapy sessions dynamically.
- **Cloud-based Monitoring**: Stores anonymized data for optimizing therapy recommendations.
